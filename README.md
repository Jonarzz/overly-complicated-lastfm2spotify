I've created two similar projects in distant past:
[in Java](https://github.com/Jonarzz/LastfmFavToSpotify) and [in Python](https://github.com/Jonarzz/LastfmLovedToSpotifyPlaylist).
I don't suppose either of them works anymore, so I thought about doing it for the third time.
This time I want to make it more complicated, so I can learn more about useful tools and technologies
and focus less on the language itself.

I hope that in the end the project works fine and serves it's purpose, but is waaay more complicated than it needs to be,
incorporating usage of, for example: Docker, Elastic Stack, Prometheus, Grafana and Resilience4j or even being deployed on AWS.
The only goal of this project is to learn as much as possible.
